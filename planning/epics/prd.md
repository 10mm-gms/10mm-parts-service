## 1. Problem Statement (The "Why")
* **Context:** 10mm GMS has no parts control and information system. It has been collecting unique information about parts for relevant vehicles, but this information is not easily accessible or usable. 
* **Problem:** The infomation needs to be homogenised, relationships between parts and vehicles need to be established and a user interface needs to be created to allow users to access and use this information. Additionally the information needs to be made available to other systems within the company via an API.
* **Evidence:** 

## 2. Value Hypothesis (The "What")
* **Hypothesis:** If we build [Parts Service], then parts information will be easily accessible and usable. It will be faster to create quotes and invoices, and stock levels of parts will be properly controlled, speeding up job execution.

## 5. Scope & Anti-Scope
### In Scope
* Web interface for managing parts and their relationships to vehicles
* Web interface for managing stock levels
* API for accessing parts information
* API for accessing stock levels
* User authorisation

### Anti-Scope (Out of Bounds)
* Mobile interface
* User authentication
